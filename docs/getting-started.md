# Getting Started

This guide aims to get you setup in the repo and able to build the code.

## Setup the repo

1. Clone / download this project
2. IDE: Download [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or Visual studio. Use Rider if you do not want to waste tons of time resizing things or trying to switch between folder paths and solution paths. Visual
   Studio is not intuitive or user friendly.
3. (optional) Unity: Download Unity Hub
    - Unity is only required if you are changing scripting related to the prefabs
4. Running things
    1. Open the whole project with Rider. Typically you can double click on ValheimRAFT.sln to open it
    2. Unity -> Open the ValheimRaftUnity folder and install the Unity 2020 version
    3. Install [AssetBundle Browser](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AssetBundles-Browser) from github master url
       or release url. Since it's not updating master is okay.
        - copy paste https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AssetBundles-Browser.git into the input under this interface
          in Unity. Window > Package Manager > (click plus arrow > click add package from giturl

## Compiling

1. Compiling with the current branch libs folder
    - You will not need to do anything. These libs are pre-built off the latest supported valheim, jotunn, bepinex.
    - Skip this step If -
        - you need to fix an issue after valheim updates, you will need to update, re-publicize, download newer bepinex
          and harmony references etc.
2. Manual Compiling
   1. Do not reference the libs folder
   2. In the valheim.targets folder change the paths of PropertyGroup with "LocalPaths" label. Make the paths match your install folders for BepInExPlugins, BepInExPath to get to Harmony and BepInEx.dll and the game folder
       - alternatively just copy paste and override all the libs folders from the GameDirectory and download the new Jotunn and other required dependencies.
3. Create a `.props` file at the top level of the project

Add the following data.
```xml
    <PropertyGroup Label="LocalPaths">
        <BepInExPath><USER_HOME_DIR>\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\Valheim\profiles\valheim_mod_debugging\BepInEx\core</BepInExPath>
        <ManagedDataPath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\valheim_Data\Managed</ManagedDataPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
```
Alternatively copy pasting the Valheim\valheim_Data\Managed and other require dependencies into "libs" will make this step unnecessary.


## Publicizing

### Publicizing Manually

Publicizing manually is not needed. There is a nuget package that handles this for us. We can drop the valheim reference into the libs folder or map to the game directory and the publicizer will automatically update the lib.
If nuget or your IDE Rider/Visual Studio do not install the provided nuget package then you may need to run `nuget restore`

### Manual Copy Paste publicizing

Publicizer for assembly_valheim steps.

   1. Alternatively To publicize, copy all the dependencies required into a separate folder. 
   2. Install https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer and run the GUI tool on that folder.
   3. Rename the __publicized assemblies back to their original names.
   4. Move those assemblies to the libs folder under ValheimRaft.
   5. Click compile. It should work.
