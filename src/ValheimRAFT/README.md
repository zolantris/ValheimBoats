# ValheimRAFT

<img src="./Thunderstore/icon.png" alt="ValheimRAFT Community Made Boat Hjalmere">

This mod aims to continue support for Water based features of the original
ValheimRAFT mod and incorporate more vehicle items and mechanics within the mod
and further extends it's capabilities.

## Build Status

[![ValheimRAFT Build](https://github.com/zolantris/ValheimRaft/actions/workflows/build-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zolantris/ValheimRaft/actions/workflows/build-release.yml)

## Background

This repo is a [ValheimRaft](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1136) fork
that works
with latest Valheim. The original mod
owner [Sarcen](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/3061574) stopped
maintaining the mod, but gave permission to maintain/improve and open source
this mod as of
12/25/2023.

## Client/Server/SinglePlayer Support

Server support may or may not work. In **>=1.6.2** ships and loading were mainly
fixed by adding some threading
optimization. There is also a config called `ServerRaftUpdateZoneInterval` this
allows users to tweak the update
frequency of checks.

The following has been tested:

- SinglePlayer
    - boats will load
    - FPS issues with giant ships
- Client only with a server IE (connecting to server without mod),
    - creating a boat and logging on and off the server does not destroy the
      boat.
    - sailing and teleporting does not destroy the boat.
    - The client will still be able to create items and the server will keep
      those raft items. (unless you have mods
      that garbage collect unused ZDOs)
    - restarting/stopping/starting server keeps the boat.
    - Removing the ValheimRAFT mod from the client will make the server glitch
      out the boat items.
    - joining back (after adding the mod again) will render the items correctly.
    - Loading a ship into view will possibly
- Server & Client
    - Loading a 4500 build plan ship. Traveling around a couple sectors. The
      ship remained as built.
    - Moving away from the ship until it unloaded. Moving back immediately and
      attempting to land on the ship while it
      renders. It works and still loads. Looks a bit funny as it spawns.
        - **Warning** to anyone that builds property next to a large ship, when
          it renders it's possible a wave could
          briefly flip it and the top part of the ship rolls and hits property.

## Features

- Build a RAFT on the water using Valheim's building prefabs.
- Adds a climbable ladder
- Add piers that reach the ocean floor (stone and log)
- Adds anchors
- Adds custom sails (requires meshes to be working)
- Adds ropes (requires meshes to be working)
- Sails now will each contribute to the total shipShip.Speed. Mesh sails do an
  area
  calculation while tier1-3 sails are
  preset values.

| fixPlanBuildPositionIssues         | Turn on/off the patches for PlanBuild, only needed if the user has PlanBuild and it adds support for ValheimRaft coordinates.

| AdminsCanOnlyBuildRaft             | (Server config) -> ValheimRAFT hammer menu pieces are registered as disabled unless the user is an Admin, allowing only admins to create rafts. This will update automatically make sure to un-equip the hammer to see it apply (if your remove yourself as admin). Server / client does not need to restart |

### Meshes

In Mod versions at or lower than `1.4.9` there were problems with the folder
being renamed. In `>=1.5.0` there is a
configuration
manager option to change the path to resolve the ValheimRAFT folder.

If you want meshes (IE sails and ropes ) to render automatically, your mod must
either be named `ValheimRAFT`
or `zolantris-ValheimRAFT`.

Otherwise make sure to edit the `pluginFolderName` key and add the folder name
for ValheimRaft located
within the BepInEx\Plugins path. Afterwards relaunch the game. There should be
no mesh issues.

## Issues

If you have a bug, please create an issue under the
repo's [issues section](https://github.com/zolantris/ValheimMods/issues).

- Please respect the form. Adding the relevant information makes it easier to
  triage the problem.

## Mod Support

In 1.6.0+ this mod
supports [PlanBuild](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1125) a popular
blueprinting mod.

Support is added via a patch that makes PlanBuild use the Raft `localPosition`
instead of world position which each item
could be moving/swaying and updating as the PlanBuild iterated through the
items. This easily breaks the Plan save.

- Hopefully this logic can be incorporated within PlanBuild directly. There is a
  config toggle to turn this patch off to
  future proof things.
- Alternative approaches for this could be doing a detection if the game object
  is attached to a parent object and
  calculating coordinates of the items **after** all object positions have been
  fetched.

Noting that Planbuild does not register well with harmony so searching for it is
not possible (from what I saw). There
is a path resolution and a config flag to enable coordinate fixes. Disable the
config value `fixPlanBuildPositionIssues`
and it should not longer cause errors for not having PlanBuild installed.

## Graphics

This project supports both **Vulkan** and **Direct3D11** as of >=1.6.11.
Previously it only supported Direct3D11.

## Contributing

1. Please fork the codebase and make a pull request via your fork branch.
2. Changes need to be feature based IE keep the changes minimal and single
   focused. Larger changes are welcome, but they
   have higher chance of breaking other things and are harder to maintain.
3. If you want to directly get involved. Reach out on discord.

## Attribution

- Sarcen: For creating the initial mod and supporting it until v1.4.8!
- Zolantris: For supporting and expanding the Raft Mod since v1.5.0.
- RacerX: For contributing a stag icon for sails. Looks awesome!

## Support Open Source

<a href='https://ko-fi.com/zolantris' target='_blank'><img height='35' style='border:0px;height:46px;' src='https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi3.png?v=0' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' />

## Logging Metrics

These packages may contain logging. Logging can be opted out by any user by
unchecking `enableMetrics`. If you choose to opt-out, please be aware, this will
make it more difficult to troubleshoot issues.

### What information will be collected
- 

- Paths related to Valheim Game directory
- Paths related to ValheimRAFT / ValheimVehicles plugin directory such as
  symlinked directories from vortex mod installer or directories created by
  r2modman or thunderstore.
- Health related to the ValheimRAFT mod. It will track performance, slowdowns,
  and bottlenecks making it significantly easier to debug.

This logging has yet to be implemented.

## Installing nuget packages

### With Rider

use Rider and click nuget (should be bottom left panel, one of the items), and
search for the package

### with nuget.exe (not recommended)

1. Install nuget.exe
2. For installing sentry as an example run.
    ```powershell
    ..\..\programs\nuget.exe install Sentry -Version 3.41.3 -OutputDirectory Packages`
    ```

The example above is if the path for nuget exists 2 directories above this repo
and within programs folder.

## Getting Started

Please reference the [getting started docs](../../docs/getting-started.md).

## Custom Logging for powershell

Add this to your powershell profile. This will allow your to highlight only logs
from ValheimVehicles and ValheimRAFT mods as well as errors.

These commands are for powershell users. If you are running things on linux
there are simpler (and similar) commands for syntax highlighting. I advise
googling them.

```powershell
function Get-LogColor {
    Param([Parameter(Position=0)]
    [String]$LogEntry)

    process {
        if ($LogEntry.Contains("ValheimRAFT") -or $LogEntry.Contains("ValheimVehicles")){
          if ($LogEntry.Contains("Debug")) {Return "Green"}
          elseif ($LogEntry.Contains("Warn")) {Return "Yellow"}
          elseif ($LogEntry.Contains("Error") -or $LogEntry.Contains("NullReferenceException")) {Return "Red"}
          else {Return "White"}
        }
        if ($LogEntry.Contains("NullReferenceException")) {Return "Red"}
        else {Return "White"}
    }
}
```

When launching the game just run the following command to output the latest
logs.

```powershell
gc -wait -tail 10 C:\Users\fre\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\Player.log | ForEach {Write-Host -ForegroundColor (Get-LogColor $_) $_}
```
