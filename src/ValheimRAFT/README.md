## Experimental Prefabs

These prefabs are not fully ready or may be broken into smaller pieces. Please
follow the description when using these prefabs and please be mindful that they
are only available early so people can test them out and/or have fun with them.
They are not meant to be balanced.

Nautilus | <img style="object-fit: scale-down;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zolantris/ValheimMods/main/src/ValheimRAFT/ValheimRAFT.Unity/Assets/ValheimVehicles/GeneratedIcons/nautilus.png" width="100"/>|
Nautilus is inspired by Jules
Verne's [20,000 Leagues Under The Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas).
Built with
original
assets by RacerX and given free to Zolantris on discord. This Prefab has all the
meshes from the boat included, but the hatch is pulled back to players can enter
the boat. It's not meant for serious play, and the recipe needs to be more
balanced + the ship needs to be fully rigged for propulsion (propellers do not
move, nor do fins).|

### Installation Guide

:warning: The Raft Mod must be installed correctly in order to resolve Custom
Sail materials. :warning:

- Folder must be placed within `<ValheimGameFolder>/BepInEx/plugins/`
- The folder must be named `ValheimRAFT` or `zolantris-ValheimRAFT` and contain
  a `Assets` folder

Noting that in future updates this may not be required, however loading custom
textures will always be supported. This allows players to drag and drop their
favorite logos or custom sail textures and see them in game.

#### Current logos

### Hull Mechanics

These mechanics apply **only** to **V2 WaterVehicles**. The older V1 rafts will
never support this feature.

Every piece of hull added to a ship will adjust the ship's floatation.
Floatation is determined by the key `HullFloatationColliderLocation`.

| Value   | Floatation Calculation Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Average | Average is the total number of hull pieces height averaged together. <br/><br>Example: 4 pieces are used with 0 height and 1 piece at height 5. The average would be (sum of height)/(number of pieces) or 5/5=1 height. If a hull is 4 pieces high the mid point (top of second piece) would be the floatation point |
| Center  | The center point between the max height hull piece on a raft and the lowest height hull piece placed on a raft. No quantity will be factored in to determine the center point.                                                                                                                                        |
| Top     | The ship will float at the top most hull piece. Likely only useful if using hull pieces to make underwater vehicles                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Bottom  | The lowest most hull pieces will determine the floatation point. Placing other prefabs that are not hull pieces can be done, but any hull piece below another one will make the ship float higher.                                                                                                                    |

## Client/Server/SinglePlayer Support

Server support may or may not work. In **>=1.6.2** ships and loading were mainly
fixed by adding some threading
optimization. There is also a config called `ServerRaftUpdateZoneInterval` this
allows users to tweak the update
frequency of checks.

The following has been tested:

- SinglePlayer
    - boats will load
    - FPS issues with giant ships
- Client only with a server IE (connecting to server without mod),
    - creating a boat and logging on and off the server does not destroy the
      boat.
    - sailing and teleporting does not destroy the boat.
    - The client will still be able to create items and the server will keep
      those raft items. (unless you have mods
      that garbage collect unused ZDOs)
    - restarting/stopping/starting server keeps the boat.
    - Removing the ValheimRAFT mod from the client will make the server glitch
      out the boat items.
    - joining back (after adding the mod again) will render the items correctly.
    - Loading a ship into view will possibly
- Server & Client
    - Loading a 4500 build plan ship. Traveling around a couple sectors. The
      ship remained as built.
    - Moving away from the ship until it unloaded. Moving back immediately and
      attempting to land on the ship while it
      renders. It works and still loads. Looks a bit funny as it spawns.
        - **Warning** to anyone that builds property next to a large ship, when
          it renders it's possible a wave could
          briefly flip it and the top part of the ship rolls and hits property.

## Config

## Issues

If you have a bug, please create an issue under the
repo's [issues section](https://github.com/zolantris/ValheimMods/issues).

- `Player.log` is required to properly debug many issues. Otherwise, you will
  not be providing enough information for maintainers to help. Please copy paste
  the log or
  /drag drop it into the github issue.
    - Player.log can be found under the User directory's AppData path for
      valheim (Same location as worldsaves). This path should work if copy
      pasting
      into Windows explorer  `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\`
    - Full path
      example `C:\Users\bob_smith\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\Player.log`
        - bob_smith - is the example username.
        - Use the `%userprofile%` to skip having to add your username or drive
          path before it.
- Please respect the form. Adding the relevant information makes it easier to
  triage the problem.

## Mod Support

In 1.6.0+ this mod
supports [PlanBuild](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1125) a popular
blueprinting mod.

Support is added via a patch that makes PlanBuild use the Raft `localPosition`
instead of world position which each item
could be moving/swaying and updating as the PlanBuild iterated through the
items. This easily breaks the Plan save.

- Hopefully this logic can be incorporated within PlanBuild directly. There is a
  config toggle to turn this patch off to
  future-proof things.
- Alternative approaches for this could be doing a detection if the game object
  is attached to a parent object and
  calculating coordinates of the items **after** all object positions have been
  fetched.

Noting that Planbuild does not register well with harmony so searching for it is
not possible (from what I saw). There
is a path resolution and a config flag to enable coordinate fixes. Disable the
config value `fixPlanBuildPositionIssues`
and it should no longer cause errors for not having PlanBuild installed.

## FAQs

Please read these if you are experiencing trouble.

### Help My Raft is A Box

1. Did you install the ValheimRAFT mod correctly?
    - No? Install it correctly following this guide, otherwise the commands may
      not work or sails will not be generated.
2. Did you upgrade from v1.x.x to >=v2.0.0?
    - Run `vehicle recontain` this command works in `>=2.0.2`
    - v2.0.0 had to make a plugin GUID change which
      likely
      broke the prefab registry of the v1 raft. This GUID change was in order to
      reset older mods from pointing to the updated ValheimRAFT and breaking
      features.
3. Are you manually installing?
    - A: Yes? Don't do it.
        - Install r2modman and have it manage your mods. This prevent a bunch of
          installation problems with raft and other mods especially as valheim
          updates.
        - https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/
    - No: Good Job, debugging the problem should be as simple as unchecking your
      mods, automatically updating things, and editing your configs.
4. Did you install a mod that is crashing the bepinex plugins?
    - Try to remove mods that are older. Many mods are not meant to endure
      updates from valheim and need a fix to make their code stable again.
      Disable all older mods and only include ValheimRAFT, Jotunn, and BepInEx.
5. Did you install a mod that overrides ValheimRAFT code?
    - Mods that override `Player.PlacePiece` will cause problems with piece
      placement.
        - Example Gizmos overrides the rotations and angles of pieces so it is
          not compatible for a boat in motion. Use `vehicle creative`
          or `raftcreative` to make the ship stop moving and place pieces.
    - Mods that override `Player.GetControlledShip` will cause the boat to be
      unable to interact or update hud or be controlled.
    - __Mods that adjust or change `Ship` Values from Valheim will no longer
      affect the V2 WaterVehicle__. This means the Vehicle is much more
      resilient
      and more compatible with mods that add new ships but also means it has
      it's own logic so the ship will not benefit OR break from those mods.

### Help My Raft Turns into a Box when I load the area

1. Are you on a dedicated server?
    - No? Switch to a dedicated server. The raft mod may not be stable when
      hosting from a LAN IP. This likely was fixed in >=2.0.0. But will continue
      to be an issue if you are using a v1 raft.
    - No, But I'm on single player...
        - Submit a bug report. Single player should render correctly. If you
          only have ValheimRAFT + Jotunn and absolutely trust your mod list.

### Help My Raft went underground

- For now there is no command to save your raft.

1. Download [Unity Explorer][unity-explorer-link]

2. Under Object list search for `WaterVehicleShip` it should show up
   as `ValheimVehicles_WaterVehicleShip`

- `ValheimVehicles` is a prefix for
  anything related to V2 RAFT/Vehicles mod.
- If you see multiple ships, make sure you click the green box to Enable/disable
  them to confirm you are changing the correct ship.

3. Change the height of the vehicle by clicking on the Object and
   within `inspector` - another pannel, click on local position and change the Y
   coordinate to +20 height or more.
    - **Make sure you never change the x or z positions**
      otherwise the boat might be removed from rendering and be sent to the
      other
      side of the world.
    - Example `Position 1600.084 29.7749 1685.39`
      Set to `1600.084 50 1685.39`

### Help My Raft Is Sinking When I Build Hulls

1. Please read
   the [guide on Vehicle Hulls][hull-mechanics-link]?
   Each Hull affects the floatation
   of the vehicle.
2. Select the correct config and add or remove a piece to see the ship update
   based on the new config value.

### My Bed does not update

**This is a known issue do the following work-around.**

- Every time the raft is moved and then stopped. Rebuild your bed and then set
  your spawn again.

This may be resolved in future updates.

## Graphics

This project supports both **Vulkan** and **Direct3D11** as of >=1.6.11.
Previously it only supported Direct3D11.

## Contributing

1. Please fork the codebase and make a pull request via your fork branch.
2. Changes need to be feature based IE keep the changes minimal and single
   focused. Larger changes are welcome, but they
   have higher chance of breaking other things and are harder to maintain.
3. If you want to directly get involved. Reach out on discord.

## Logging Metrics

These packages may contain logging. Logging can be opted out by any user by
unchecking `enableMetrics`. If you choose to opt-out, please be aware, this will
make it more difficult to troubleshoot issues.

- Logging does not do anything without a SentryUnityPlugin package that has not
  been made available to the community (yet). In future updates Sentry logging
  will be recommended to beta testing players so benchmarks can be collected
  related to Vehicle performance.

### What information will be collected

- Paths related to Valheim Game directory
- Paths related to ValheimRAFT / ValheimVehicles plugin directory such as
  symlinked directories from vortex mod installer or directories created by
  r2modman or thunderstore.
- Health related to the ValheimRAFT mod. It will track performance, slowdowns,
  and bottlenecks making it significantly easier to debug.

This logging has yet to be implemented.
