<img src="./Thunderstore/icon.png" alt="ValheimRAFT Community Made Boat Hjalmere">

A [ValheimRaft](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1136) fork that works with latest Valheim. The original mod
owner [Sarcenzzz](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/3061574) abandoned the
mod, this fork aims to keep the mod functional with future goals of expanding functionality.

## Client/Server/SinglePlayer Support

Server support may or may not work. In **>=1.6.2** ships and loading were mainly fixed by adding some threading
optimization. There is also a config called `ServerRaftUpdateZoneInterval` this allows users to tweak the update
frequency of checks.

The following has been tested:

- SinglePlayer
    - boats will load
    - FPS issues with giant ships
- Client only with a server IE (connecting to server without mod),
    - creating a boat and logging on and off the server does not destroy the boat.
    - sailing and teleporting does not destroy the boat.
    - The client will still be able to create items and the server will keep those raft items. (unless you have mods
      that garbage collect unused ZDOs)
    - restarting/stopping/starting server keeps the boat.
    - Removing the ValheimRAFT mod from the client will make the server glitch out the boat items.
    - joining back (after adding the mod again) will render the items correctly.
    - Loading a ship into view will possibly
- Server & Client
    - Loading a 4500 build plan ship. Traveling around a couple sectors. The ship remained as built.
    - Moving away from the ship until it unloaded. Moving back immediately and attempting to land on the ship while it
      renders. It works and still loads. Looks a bit funny as it spawns.
        - **Warning** to anyone that builds property next to a large ship, when it renders it's possible a wave could
          briefly flip it and the top part of the ship rolls and hits property.

## Features

## Config

### InitialRaftFloorHeight

| ConfigName                   | Description                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InitialRaftFloorHeight       | Lets you set the height of the floors so they do not clip. Recommended to stay between 0.4 and 0.6.                          |
| ServerRaftUpdateZoneInterval | Set interval in seconds for the server update to trigger and re-render pieces if in view                                     |
| pluginFolderName             | Allows you to specify the plugin folder if it's been renamed. See the meshes section below for more details                  |
| raftHealth                   | Set the raft health for wear and tear. I set it to `500` default, but it was originally `10000` which is not balanced        |
| fixPlanBuildPositionIssues   | Turn on/off the patches for PlanBuild, only needed if the user has PlanBuild and it adds support for ValheimRaft coordinates |

### Meshes

In Mod versions at or lower than `1.4.9` there were problems with the folder being renamed. In `>=1.5.0` there is a
configuration
manager option to change the path to resolve the ValheimRAFT folder.

If you want meshes (IE sails and ropes ) to render automatically, your mod must either be named `ValheimRAFT`
or `zolantris-ValheimRAFT`.

Otherwise make sure to edit the `pluginFolderName` key and add the folder name for ValheimRaft located
within the BepInEx\Plugins path. Afterwards relaunch the game. There should be no mesh issues.

## Mod Support

In 1.6.0+ this mod supports [PlanBuild](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1125) a popular blueprinting mod.

Support is added via a patch that makes PlanBuild use the Raft `localPosition` instead of world position which each item
could be moving/swaying and updating as the PlanBuild iterated through the items. This easily breaks the Plan save.

- Hopefully this logic can be incorporated within PlanBuild directly. There is a config toggle to turn this patch off to
  future proof things.
- Alternative approaches for this could be doing a detection if the game object is attached to a parent object and
  calculating coordinates of the items **after** all object positions have been fetched.

## Contributing

1. Please fork the codebase and make a pull request via your fork branch.
2. Changes need to be feature based IE keep the changes minimal and single focused. Larger changes are welcome, but they
   have higher chance of breaking other things and are harder to maintain.
