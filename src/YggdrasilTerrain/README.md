# Yggdrasil Terrain

A terrain mod allowing for physical access and building on the Yggdrasil branch
in the sky.

## Features

- makes the yggdrasil root physical
- Support player walking on the root
- Building type collisions.
- Building can be built on the Yggdrasil root.
- Vehicle collisions,
    - carts and other vanilla pieces
    - raft vehicles (requires custom rudder config values. Set the base speeds
      to extreme numbers. Requires flying the raft to the Yggdrassil branch in
      the
      current raft mod).
- Allows for collision overrides via config.

## Config Commands

- `yggdrasilTerrain teleport` requires the user to be an admin in order to
  teleport to the yggdrasil root directly.

## Possible Future plans

- improve teleportation based on location on map and pinpoint the accuracy so
  player is set directly on the root without falling
